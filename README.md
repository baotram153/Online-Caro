- Notes
    - Every machines have to listen to the same port
    - Imagine having 3 machines
        - Once a host turn on the game, it will listen to port 29999, and send request to other hosts on this port
            - If a connection is formed
                - It will recieved the name of the player -> put into player list
            - If a connection is not formed
                - That host is not a player
    - Simple version
        - 1 machine as server and the other as client

- Initial server
    - 
- Initial client
