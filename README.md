- Notes
    - Every machines have to listen to the same port
    - If client press "/", a closing message is sent to server, client socket is closed
    - Imagine having 3 machines
        - Once a host turn on the game, it will listen to port 29999, and send request to other hosts on this port
        - If that host is listening to the same port, a connection will be formed in another port
            - Listen port: discover players
            - Connect port: play game together
        - Shared queue is used to exchange message from peer program to game program
        - If a connection is formed
            - It will recieved the name of the player -> put into player list
        - If a connection is not formed
            - That host is not a player
    - 1 machine testing
        - Listen port and connect port has to be different
- Initial server
    - 
- Initial client
